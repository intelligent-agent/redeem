=============
Documentation
=============

`ReStructured Text (RST) <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ is a markdown language
with additional directives for table of contents, tables and footnotes, among other things. It can also be
configured to pull docstrings directly from the code base. `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_
is a python-based document generator which converts RST into HTML docs for browsing
and searching. Gulp is used as a makefile and to convert LESS stylesheets into CSS.

Web-based Updates
-----------------

Github can be used to do most page updates. To begin, click on the 'edit on github' link at the top
right of the page you'd like to edit. Log in to your github account; or create one and verify your
email address.

The primary repository can not be edited directly; github will prompt you to create your own copy,
called a fork. Edit the file using and preview the changes. When you are finished, write a quick
summary of the change and click "Propose file change". This will create a pull request and notify
the development team of the suggested update. Once accepted, the documentation will automatically
be updated on ``develop`` branch.

Dependencies
------------


If you're updating docs locally, you'll need to install a few python modules. This is required because Sphinx
reads docstrings from the code base and adds them to the documentation:

::

    pip install tests/modules.txt
    pip install docs/requirements.txt

Next you'll need to install a few node-based tools which are used to process the visual theme: `Node Package Manager <https://www.npmjs.com/>`_ and `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/en/>`_.

``brew install npm yarn`` (for mac osx) or ``apt-get install npm yarn`` (for linux)

Assuming you have the redeem git repo already cloned, install the remainder of the node packages:

::

    $ cd redeem/docs
    $ yarn

To build the docs::

    ``$ gulp docs``

Or if you'd like it to build every time a change is made to code or docs, use ``gulp watch``.

The output is placed in the `/docs/_build/html` directory and, since it's static, can be opened
directly from a browser.

Mediawiki to RST
----------------

`Pandoc`__ is a tool that converts between multiple different markup and markdown formats. When converting from
mediawiki to restructured text, it converts about 90% of the formatting without need for manual refactoring.

__ https://pandoc.org/

To install: ``brew install pandoc``

To convert from mediawiki:

#. go to the mediawiki page and click `Edit`

#. copy and paste the content into a text file. eg. mywikipage.mw

#. run pandoc: ``pandoc -r mediawiki -w rst mywikipage.mw > mywikipage.rst``

#. edit as needed

Release Build (Versions)
------------------------

The build process which produces the current and past versions of the documentation requires
that all files are committed, pushed and have a tag with the format of `X.X` or `X.X.X`. There
is a gulp command that handles all of the configuration::

    $ gulp build-versions

Commonly Used Syntax
--------------------


Emphasis
~~~~~~~~

*emphasis* is rendered as italics

**strong emphasis** is rendered as bold


Code
~~~~

``literal`` is used for highlighting code or commands inline.

::

    def blockOfCode(a, b):
        return a + b



Hyperlinks
~~~~~~~~~~

`Display Name <http://link/to/external/site/>`_ is a link to an external site; it will open in a new window.

:doc:`../replicape/index` is used to reference another piece of the same documentation using the title of that doc.

Or it can be used to name the link to something different :doc:`Go to Replicape </replicape/index>` uses an alternative displayed name.


Lists
~~~~~

- a
- list
- of
- unordered
- things

1. a
2. list
3. of
4. ordered
5. things

Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  important:: a piece of information to be highlighted

..  note:: information that is thought of as a best practice. read more about it :doc:`here <documentation>`.

..  warning:: this should be used to highlight a backwards incompatible change

..  danger:: do not do ``this`` as something maybe damaged or lost

..  versionadded:: X.Y.Z


Images
~~~~~~

An image is shown as a thumbnail; full size is viewable by clicking on it:

..  image:: images/replicapelogo.png

Figures have other options, including using a caption:

..  figure:: images/replicapelogo.png

    A caption describing this figure.

..  [#f1] Text of the first footnote.
..  [#f2] Text of the second footnote.
