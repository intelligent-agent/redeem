Configuration Settings
======================

-  All units are in SI-units internally in Redeem, but g-codes often expose mm etc.
-  ``default.cfg`` is the bible, all configs must be defined in there.
-  All configurations in default.cfg can be overridden
-  default.cfg and printer.cfg can be changed with updates. ``local.cfg`` can not.
-  Here is the config hierarchy: ``local.cfg`` > ``printer.cfg`` > ``deafult.cfg``

For Redeem, the preferred way to handle configuration is through the web
interface. The web interface is available through
`kamikaze.local <http://kamikaze.local>`__ assuming you have your BeagleBone on the
local network and you are using Umikaze 2.1.1.

The config files for redeem are present in the folder ``/etc/redeem/``.
There are three files for setting the configuration. ``default.cfg`` is the
catch-all at the bottom. It will contain all the possible options and
**should not be touched**. Second is ``printer.cfg`` which is a symlink and
specific to a printer. Look in the folder to find one that matches your
printer. If you cannot find one, make it! *Otherwise leave the existing
one as is.* Finally is local.cfg which contains quirks or other
individual settings. The ``local.cfg`` will not be overwritten by new
software updates and can contain stuff like microstepping, stepper
current, offsets as well as any bed compensation matrices etc.

Now normally all settings can come from your specific ``printer.cfg`` config
file, but if no one has made that file, you need to set this stuff up
yourself. Most of the stuff in the config files is in SI units. This is
perhaps different than what other firmwares do, where the focus is on
optimization rather than ease of use. Note that it is important to keep
the section headers in the same case as the examples or ``default.cfg`` as
they are case sensitive.

..  important::

    If you edit a config file incorrectly, redeem will fail to load and
    you will be unable to connect in octoprint. You must use headers, as
    shown in the examples, and consistent spacing/formatting. Also the first
    time you load octoprint you will not have any config files listed in
    settings/redeem, you are supposed to load a blank local.cfg file. You
    shouldn't need to do this again unless you reflash the image. However,
    if you find that your config files suddenly when missing, simply close
    your browser tab and reopen octoprint and they should return.

..  note::

    If you are not writing your own new ``printer.cfg``, keep all your printer
    settings in ``local.cfg`` to avoid getting any setting over-written by a redeem update.

.. _ConfigSystem:

System
------

The system section has only Replicape board revision and log level. For
debugging purposes, set the log level to 10, but keep it at 20 for
normal operations, since logging is very CPU intensive and can cause
delays during prints at high speed. On later versions of Redeem, the
board revision is read from the EEPROM on the Replicape.

.. _ConfigGeometry:

Geometry
--------

The geometry section contains stuff about the physical layout of your
printer. What the print volume is, what the offset from the end stops
is, whether it's a Normal XY style printer, a Delta printer, an H-belt
type printer or a CoreXY type printer.

It also contains the bed compensation matrix. The bed compensation
matrix is used for compensating any rotation the bed has in relation
to the nozzle. This is typically not something you write yourself, but
instead it is found by probing the bed at different locations by use
of the G-code G29. The G29 command is a macro command, so it only runs
other G-codes and you can override it yourself in the local.cfg file
or in the printer.cfg file if you are a printer manufacturer.

.. _ConfigDelta:

Delta
-----

Several variables are needed for defining the geometry of the delta setup.

Terminology:

- Effector is the thing that is in the centre and moves (the one with the hot end)

- The distance from the centre of the effector to where the rods are mounted is the effector offset.

- Carriage is those that move up and down along the columns.


:todo:`TODO`

..  warning::

    I've not figured out what the carriage offset does. You should think
    this was the offset from the carriages to the rods, but I've not
    gotten that top work. Seems broken. Instead, add the carriage offset
    to the effector offset.

- the stepper max current
- the microstepping

  Never run the Replicape with the steppers running above 0.5A without cooling.
  Never exceed 1.2A of regular use either - the TMC2100 drivers aren't
  rated higher. If you need more current to drive two motors off the
  same stepper, use slave mode with a second driver (usually H). While it
  means splitting off your wiring of the stepper motors you had going to
  a single driver, but it also means you avoid overheating your drivers.

..  _ConfigStepperDecay:

Decay
~~~~~

The decay mode affects the way the stepper motor controllers
decays the current. Basically slow decay will give more of a hissing
sound while standing still and fast decay will cause the steppers to
be silent when stationary, but loud when stepping. The microstepping_
settings is :math:`2^x`, so ``microstepping_x = 2`` means :math:`2^2 = 4`.
``3`` then is :math:`2^3 = 8` or one-eighth.

On Replicape Rev B, there are 8 levels of decay. Please consult the `data sheet for TMC2100`__ on the different options.

__ http://www.trinamic.com/_scripts/download.php?file=_articles%2Fproducts%2Fintegrated-circuits%2Ftmc2100%2F_datasheet%2FTMC2100_datasheet.pdf


There are three settings that are controlled on the TMC2100 by the decay mode or rather “chopper configuration”: CFG0,
CFG4 and CFG5 in the TMC2100 data sheet.

**CFG0:** Sets chopper off time (Duration of slow decay phase)

| DIS - 140 Tclk (recommended, most universal choice)
| EN - 236 Tclk (medium)

**CFG4:** Sets chopper hysteresis (Tuning of zero crossing precision)

| DIS: (recommended most universal choice): low hysteresis with ≈4% offull scale current.
| EN: high setting with ≈6% of full scale current at sense resistor.


**CFG5:** Sets chopper blank time ( Duration of blanking of switching spike )

| Blank time (in number of clock cycles)
| DIS - 16 (best performance for StealthChop)
| EN - 24 (recommended, most universal choice)

    # Stepper timout
    use_timeout = True
    timeout_seconds = 500

If you want to enable slave mode for a stepper driver, meaning it will
mirror the movements of another stepper motor exactly, you need to use
“slave\_y = H” if you want the H-stepper motor to mirror the moves
produced by the Y-stepper motor. Remember to also set the steps\_pr\_mm
to the same value on the the motors mirroring each other, and also the
direction. Most likely you will want the current to be the same as well.

#. Enable the slave stepper driver (in\_use\_h = True)
#. The syntax for selecting which axis is the master and which the slave
   is:
   I want to slave H to Z (H follows everything Z does) then you use
   “slave\_z = H”.
#. If you have any endstops acting on the master axis, then you should
   do the same thing for the slave axis, otherwise it will just keep on
   turning. For example, on a delta with Z1 connected to a bed probe and
   Z2 connected to the tower limit switch: “end\_stop\_Z1\_stops =
   x\_neg, y\_neg, z\_neg, h\_neg” and “end\_stop\_Z2\_stops = z\_pos,

Planner
-------

The acceleration profiles are trapezoidal, i.e. constant acceleration.
One will probably see and hear a difference between Replicape/Redeem and
the simpler 8 bit boards since all path segments are cut down to 0.1 mm
on delta printers regardless of speed and there is also a better
granularity on the stepper ticks, so you will never have quantized steps
either. Further more, all calculations are done with floating point
numbers, giving a better precision on calculations compared to 8 bit
microcontrollers.

This section is concerned with how the path planner caches and paces the
path segments before pushing them to the PRU for processing.

.. _ConfigTemperatureControl:

Temperature Control
-------------------
Thermal management is implemented in Redeem through a user configurable network 
of sensors, heaters and fans. The user specifies the nodes of this network where
each node is a uniquely configured instance from a pre-defined set. This approach 
allows a high degree of flexibility in setting up when fans/heaters turn on or off, 
the type of control logic that is used for each heater/fan, and even allowing 
multiple sensors to control the behaviour of an individual heater or fan. 

In order to allow for basic operation of your printer there are some default settings 
provided for attaching fans to the `M106` M-code, controlling heaters with PID control, 
and running safety checks on these heaters. However, as the topology of the control 
network is user definable, the contents of this section may be modified by the user
to allow for a much wider range of options. To aid in generating a network of sensors, 
logic units, control units, heaters, and fans, each of the available units will be 
described below. Then some examples will be shown that demonstrate the flexibility of the 
scheme.

Available control units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Units that are available to make up the control network are shown in this section. 
The name of each unit is provided in the sub-section heading `[[UnitName]]`, with 
all of the settings for that unit held within that sub-section. All temperature 
control units have a type parameter which determines what that unit does and the 
parameters it needs. We will now go through the available types of units.

**ALIAS** The alias unit is, as the name suggests, a way of renaming other units. This is useful 
when renaming temperature sensors from their original name such as ``Thermistor-E`` to
``Hot End Temperature`` or ``ds18b20-1`` to ``Ambient Temperature``.

::

    [[AliasUnitName]]
    type = alias
    input = <name of another unit>
    
    
**COMPARISON** The compraison unit compares values and returns a single value. The
returned value may be the difference (``input_0 - input_1``) or the maximum or minumum
value.

::

    [[ComparisonUnitName]]
    type = difference, maximum, or minimum
    input_0 = <name of input>
    input_1 = <name of input>
    
**CONSTANT** Allows for the use of constants as a control item. This unit simply returns 
the value that is provided. Note that the input is assumed to lie within the range [0,255].

::

    [[ConstantName]]
    type = constant-control
    value = <number in range 0..255>
    output = <optional output target name>

**SAFETY** Safety units link temperature sensors and heaters so that a heater that misbehaves
in any way should cause all heaters, and potentially the motion control as well, to enter an
error state. This means that all heaters have their power set to zero and motion stops. The
max rise and fall rates provide limits on excessively rapid changes in temperature, while min 
and max temp limits the absolute temperatures that are allowed. The ``min_rise_`` parameters 
allow for checking that the attached input is actually connected to this heater. To avoid false 
triggering, when temperature is close to steady-state, we provide the ``min_rise_offset`` 
parameter which only allows for ``min_rise_rate`` checking when the input temperature is 
``min_rise_offset`` below the heater controllers target temperature. Likewise the ``min_rise_delay``
provides a delay between starting heating and beginning this particular check.

::

    [[SafetyName]]
    type = safety
    max_rise_rate = <number, deg/sec>
    max_fall_rate = <number, deg/sec>
    min_temp = <number, deg>
    max_temp = <number, deg>
    min_rise_rate = <number, deg/sec>
    min_rise_offset = <number, deg>
    min_rise_delay = <number, sec>
    input = <input sensor name>
    heater = <heater name>

**ON-OFF CONTROL** This control scheme is best suited to heated beds and the like, where
response to being on or off is relatively slow. In this unit a target value is specified
as well as a range within which the heater may be on or off depending on its previous state.
When the input value is below ``target_value + on_offset`` the output will be ``on_value``.
When the input value rises above ``target_value + off_offset`` the output will be ``off_value``.
Note that the output does not turn off when passing through the lower bound, only when it passes
through the upper bound. Here we are also introduced to the ``sleep`` parameter which gives the
time between updating the output from this control unit.

::

    [[OnOffName]]
    type=on-off-control
    target_value = <number>
    on_offset = <number, turn on when value <= target + on_offset>
    off_offset = <number, turn off when value >= target + off_offset>
    on_value = <number in range 0..255>
    off_value = <number in range 0..255>
    sleep = <number, sec, time between control updates>
    output = <optional output target name>
    
**PROPORTIONAL CONTROL** This unit returns a value that is simply ``proportional`` multiplied by
the difference between ``target_value`` and ``input``, along with some other modifications. These
modifications are that we don't allow negative output values and if ``input`` drops below 
``target_value`` then the unit turns off (``output = 0``). If we are within ``ok_range`` of the
target then ``output`` will be the ``min_value`` and we never allow the output to exceed ``max_value``.

::

    [[ProportionalControlName]]
    type = proportional-control
    input = <name of input>
    target_value = <number, desired temperature>
    proportional = <number, multiplier of error>
    max_value = <number in range 0..255>
    min_value = <number in range 0..255>
    ok_range = <number, output=min_value if input is within ok_range of target>
    sleep = <number, sec, time between control updates>
    output = <optional output target name>

**PID CONTROL** The control unit best for keeping your input exactly where you want it
is Proportional-Integral -Derivative control. This unit accepts three parameters which
govern the dynamics of the controller (you are encouraged to look up exactly what 
``pid_Kp``, ``pid_Ti``, and ``pid_Td`` actually do, I'm not going into that here).
Again we have an ``ok_range`` within which the controller will output zero, however, we
also have an ``on_off_range`` which basically turns this control unit full on until 
``input`` is above ``target_value - on_off_range``. This helps to prevent overshoot
in certain cases.

With version 1.2.6 and beyond, the PID autotune algorithm is fairly
stable. To run an auto-tune, use the M-code M303. You should see the
hot-end or heated bed temperature oscillate for a few cycles before
completing. To set temperature, number of oscillations, which hot end to
calibrate etc, try running “M303?” or see the description of the :ref:`M303`.

**COMMANDS** To allow linking between G- and M-codes we have the gcode type unit. 
Currently this only connects ``M106`` and ``M107`` to fans but this may change in 
the future. The default setting has connected all fans to ``M106`` and ``M107``, 
if you only want specific fans connected to these M-codes then list only those 
fans in the ``ouput`` paramter as a comma separated list.

Dallas one-wire sensors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replicape has three thermistor inputs and a Dallas one-wire input.
Typically, the thermistor inputs are for high temperatures such as hot
ends and heated beds, and the Dallas one-wire input is used for
monitoring the cold end of a hot end, if you know what I mean... 
The thermistors have their own section, which will be outlined below, 
while any appropriate sensors attached to the Dallas one-wire input will 
be automatically added to the list of available sensors and named 
``ds18b20-*`` with an increasing integer index starting at 0 taking the 
place of the *. When using one of these sensors as an input simply 
use the appropriate name as an input, just make sure to check which 
name corresponds to which sensor!

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Here we provide some examples and an explanation of what each one achieves.

**(EXAMPLE 1)**
In this example I have connected up my extruder heater ``Heater-E`` to a
pid control unit with an on-off range of 15 degrees. This helps to prevent
overshoot of the target value when initially heating. The heated bed 
``Heater-HBP`` is connected to an on-off controller. I have also defined two 
safety units and connected one to each heater. I also have two thermistors, 
one for each heater, and two Dallas one-wire sensors which I have attached 
to measure water coolant temperature and ambient air temperature. My printer 
incorporates three fans, one is a very quiet case fan and should always be on, 
another is a part cooling fan and should be activated by M106, finally I have 
a noisy fan on a water cooling radiator that I only want to turn on when 
it will be useful. To achieve my desired fan behaviour I first rename each Dallas 
sensor for ease of use and calculate the difference between the coolant and 
ambient temperatures. I feed this difference into a proportional controller 
with a target value of zero which outputs to the noisy radiator fan. The 
casefan is always on and so it has a constant controller while the third fan 
is connected to M106/M107. The fourth fan remains off by default.

.. _ConfigThermistors:

Thermistors
-----------

Each thermistor is named according to the
heater to which it is expected to be attached i.e. ``Thermistor-E`` 
is usually attached to ``Heater-E``. Thermistors measure temperature by 
varying resistance through a wire. To map the variation in resistance with 
temperature a chart is used. The name provided in the ``sensor`` parameter 
thus tells redeem which pre-computed chart to use and thus provide accurate 
readings of the temperature at the thermistors location. The ``path_adc`` 
parameter is hardware related and should not be adjusted.

::

    [[Thermistor-E]]
    sensor = B57560G104F
    path_adc = /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_voltage4_raw
    

Some of the most common thermistor coefficients have already been
implemented though, so you might find it here:

..   _ConfigFans:

Fans
-------

Fans are used for blowing air around. Each sensor is named ``Fan-*`` with an
integer identification, starting at zero, replacing the *. Different versions 
of replicape have different numbers of fans and are connected to different channels,
but don't worry, all that is handled for you and I am writing this information here
simply to point out that you may only have up to ``Fan-2`` and you don't need to 
modify the value of ``channel`` as it will be overwritten on startup anyway. The 
``input`` for each fan allows a simple method for setting a default value for that
fan upon startup. Otherwise connect it up to a control unit for fancier means of 
setting how much air you are blowing around.

::

    [[Fan-0]]
    channel = 0
    input = 0


..   _ConfigHeaters:

Heaters
-------

The heaters are used for making things hot. The ``mosfet`` parameter is hardware related,
so probably don't touch that. Likewise for ``prefix`` which allows for interaction with
OctoPrint. The ``input`` and ``safety`` give connections to control units that can be
modfied versions of the defaults provided, or something of your choice. Note that we must
always have a form of feedback control (on-off, proportional or PID) and a safety attached 
to each heater. You may also have more than one safety attached to a heater if you so desire.

::

    [[Heater-E]]
    mosfet = 5
    prefix = T0
    input = Control-E
    safety = Safety-E

..  _ConfigEndstops:

Endstops
--------

Use this section to specify whether or not you have end stops on the
different axes and how the end stop inputs on the board interacts with
the steppers. The lookup mask is useful for the latter. In the default
setup, the connector marked X1 is connected to the stepper on the
X-axis. For CoreXY and H-bot this is different in that two steppers are
denied movement in one direction, but allowed movement in the other
direction given that one of the end stops has been hit.

Also of interest is the use of two different inputs for a single axis
and direction. Imagine using one input to control the lower end of the
Z-axis and a different input to probe the bed with G20/G30.

If you are not seeing any movement even though no end stop has been hit,
try inverting the end stop.

See also this `blog post and video`__ for a more thorough explanation.

__ http://www.thing-printer.com/end-stop-configuration-for-redeem/

Soft end stops can be used to prevent the print head from moving beyond
a specified point. For delta printers this is useful since they cannot
have end stops preventing movement outside the build area.

::

    [Endstops]
    # Which axis should be homed.
    has_x = True
    ...
    # Number of cycles to wait between checking
    # end stops. CPU frequency is 200 MHz
    end_stop_delay_cycles = 1000

    # Invert =
    #   True means endstop is connected as Normally Open (NO) or not connected
    #   False means endstop is connected as Normally Closed (NC)
    invert_X1 = False
    ...
    # If one endstop is hit, which steppers and directions are masked.
    #   The list is comma separated and has format
    #     x_cw = stepper x clockwise (independent of direction_x)
    #     x_ccw = stepper x counter clockwise (independent of direction_x)
    #     x_neg = stepper x negative direction (affected by direction_x)
    #     x_pos = stepper x positive direction (affected by direction_x)
    #   Steppers e and h (and a, b, c for reach) can also be masked.
    #
    #   For a list of steppers to stop, use this format: x_cw, y_ccw
    #   For Simple XYZ bot, the usual practice would be
    #     end_stop_X1_stops = x_neg, end_stop_X2_stops = x_pos, ...
    #   For CoreXY and similar, two steppers should be stopped if an end stop is hit.
    #     similarly for a delta probe should stop x, y and z.
    end_stop_X1_stops =
    ...
    soft_end_stop_min_x = -0.5
    ...
    soft_end_stop_max_x = 0.5

Multi-extrusion
---------------

Currently Redeem does not yet support tool offsets for dual or
multi-extrusion. These offsets must be configured in the slicer, instead
of in the firmware, for now.

..  _ConfigServos:

Servos
------

Servos are controlled by two on-chip PWMs and share connector with
Endstop X2 and Y2.

-  Servo 0 is on pin P9\_14
-  Servo 1 is on pin P9\_16

Use :ref:`m280` to set
the servo position. Note that multiple servos can be present, the init
script will continue to initialize servos as long as there are higher
indexes, so keep the indexes increasing for multiple servos.

::

    [Servos]
    # For Rev B, servo is either P9_14 or P9_16.
    # Not enabled for now, just kept here for reference.
    # Angle init is the angle the servo is set to when redeem starts.
    # pulse min and max is the pulse with for min and max position, as always in SI unit Seconds.
    # So 0.001 is 1 ms.
    # Angle min and max is what angles those pulses correspond to.
    servo_0_enable = False
    servo_0_channel = P9_14
    servo_0_angle_init = 90
    servo_0_angle_min = -90
    servo_0_angle_max = 90
    servo_0_pulse_min = 0.001
    servo_0_pulse_max = 0.002

..  _ConfigZProbe:

Z-Probe
-------

Before attempting the configuration of a Z probe make sure your printer
is moving in the right direction and that your hard endstops and your
soft endstops are configured correctly please refer to the endstop
section.

| The standard configs for Z-probe should work for most. The real
  difficulty lies in making the macro for the whole probing procedure.
  The offsets are the distance from the probe point to the nozzle. Here
  are the standard values:

::

    [Probe]
    length = 0.01
    speed = 0.05
    accel = 0.1
    offset_x = 0.0
    offset_y = 0.0

For more information, check out the :doc:`/support/howto/zprobes` page.

..  _ConfigRotaryEncoders:

---------------

..  warning::

    work in progress.

::

    [Rotary-encoders]
    enable-e = False
    event-e = /dev/input/event1
    cpr-e = -360
    diameter-e = 0.003

..  _ConfigFilamentSensors:

Filament Sensors
----------------

.. warning::

    work in progress. See the blog post `Filament Sensor <http://www.thing-printer.com/filament-sensor-3d-printer-replicape/>`_.

::

    [Filament-sensors]
    # If the error is > 1 cm, sound the alarm
    alarm-level-e = 0.01

..  _ConfigWatchdog:

Watchdog
--------

The watchdog is a time-out alarm that will kick in if the
/dev/watchdog file is not written at least once pr. minute. This is a
safety issue that will cause the BeagleBone to issue a hard reset if
the Redeem daemon were to enter a faulty state and not be able to
regulate the heater elements. For the watchdog to start, it requires
the watchdog to be resettable, with the proper kernel command line ``omap\_wdt.nowayout=0``.

This should be left on at all time as a safety precauchion, but can be
disabled for development purposes. This is not the same as the stepper
watchdog which only disables the steppers.

::

    [Watchdog]
    enable_watchdog = True

..  _ConfigMacros:

Macros
------

The macro-section contains macros. Duh. Right now, only G29, G31 and G32
has macro definitions and it's basically a set of other G-codes. To make
a new macro, you need to also define the actual g-code file for it. That
is beyond this wiki, but look at `G29`__ in the repository.

__  https://github.com/intelligent-agent/redeem/src/73c21486b1e294570a125e9fac6c9cef9b4f273b/redeem/gcodes/G29.py?at=develop

..  note::

    Each line in macros section needs to be spaced the same or you may
    not be able to connect in octoprint. Most Inductive sensors don't need
    probe type defined to work. To simply turn an inductive sensor on and
    off change the example macro with the g31/g32 macro's i have listed
    here. The g32 may need adjusting to match your z1 endstop settings.
    Undock turns probe on, Dock turns it off. Check your Macro and setup
    carefully, in the g29 example, at the end of each probe point it docks
    your probe then homes z before the start of the next point, which in
    some printers can crash your probe into the bed possibly causing damage.

If you find that your probe routine is probing the air, your z
axis is most likely moving in the wrong direction for the probing
to work. It seems redeem only probes in one direction and this
can't be changed in the probing settings. So, You will need to
swap your z direction, in the [steppers] section using
direction\_z = -1 or direction\_z = +1, then confirm your z
stops/homing, ect work make corrections as required. You will also
most likely need to change under [Geometry] travel\_z direction.
This should trick the probe into moving in the correct direction.
