Bugs can be reported at `Redeem on Github <https://github.com/intelligent-agent/redeem/issues>`.


The Replicape/Redeem community is mostly active in three places:

-  `The Replicape Slack <http://www.thing-printer.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation>`__
-  `IRC on #replicape (irc.freenode.net) <https://webchat.freenode.net/>`__
-  Google+ community: `Thing-printer <https://plus.google.com/communities/104577360369030938514>`__



Redeem's and Kamikaze's pages are pretty complete already, you're here
reading sort of a “where do I find information about specific topics?”

The answer is:

-  `Replicape's <#>`__ page for anything to do with
   hardware connections (wiring, outputs, etc.)
-  `Redeem <#>`__'s page for anything to do with what features the
   software holds, and what G and M-codes do
-  `Kamikaze <#>`__'s page for anything regarding the Kamikaze
   image, including the latest release link for Kamikaze (network,
   updates, etc).
-  `The Marlin to Redeem <#>`__ guide, helping those of
   you coming from Marlin appreciate what the differences in Redeem are
   and why.
