## Installation options

### BeagleBone image

Umikaze (based on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS)

### Source install

**WARNING**: The current `master` branch is considered stable, though not yet released while we integrate a few more features to release 2.2.1.
As such, please note that as of this latest change to the master branch, you should be building Redeem off a platform similar to that built by the [https://github.com/intelligent-agent/Umikaze](Umikaze) 
[https://github.com/intelligent-agent/Umikaze/blob/master/Packages/install_redeem](Redeem build script).

The build script will not run as a standalone, however it does include all dependency installations and virtual environment setup, as well as inclusion of the systemd service integration.
